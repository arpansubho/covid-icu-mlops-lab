# MLOps Mini Project – COVID Mortality Prediction

## Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning system to predict COVID patient mortality using structured medical data.

We demonstrate:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Model training (baseline + stronger model)
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- API serving with FastAPI
- Dockerized inference
- CI with tests

## Target
Binary classification:
- 1 = patient died  
- 0 = patient survived  

Derived from `DATE_DIED`.
